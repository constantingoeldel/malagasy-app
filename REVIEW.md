# Review for your malagasy app

_If you have any questions regarding the review, please come see me._

To explain the grading for each individual component, please see comments in those files.
General Issues:

1. Instead of duplicating styles think about how to combine them
2. Only use props that are actually delivered when the funtion is called
3. Use naming that is descriptive (ItemId1 is not)
